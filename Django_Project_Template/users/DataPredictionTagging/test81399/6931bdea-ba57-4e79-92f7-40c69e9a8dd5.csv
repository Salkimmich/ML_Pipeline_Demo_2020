It has been extremely difficult for our small group to maintain bi-monthly meetings. While the groups are divided geographically within the county, my particular group is not close enough to meet in person. Because we're doing digital meetings, I think it would be better to organize groups based on schedule availability, rather than geographic location. Or perhaps give participants the opportunity to select which option works best for them. My final thought is a request for more clarity in regards to the final project.
